# 👋 Welcome to My LangChain Journey  
### *From Prompts → Agents → Autonomous AI Systems*

This repository documents my personal journey into the world of **AI Agents, LangChain, LLM orchestration, and real-world AI automation**.

I am learning how to go beyond simple chatbots and build **intelligent systems** that can think, act, use tools, remember, and eventually operate autonomously.

This is not just a coding journey —  
it's my path to becoming an **AI Agent Engineer**.

## 🎯 Why LangChain?

LangChain is the **operating system for LLM-powered applications**.  
It allows us to:

- Structure prompts and reasoning
- Add tools and external actions
- Integrate memory and context
- Connect with vector DBs (RAG)
- Create multi-agent workflows
- Move from *text-generation* → *decision-making*

If LLMs are the **brain**, LangChain is the **nervous system**.

## 🚀 My Mission

✔️ Understand how modern AI agents are built  
✔️ Learn LangChain step by step  
✔️ Create weekly projects that demonstrate real capabilities  
✔️ Build a production-ready capstone agent by the end

This repo will serve as:

📂 A **portfolio** of everything I create  
🧠 A **knowledge base** of what I learn  
🔥 Proof of my commitment to the AI revolution

## 📅 Progress Structure

My learning is broken into **weekly modules**, each with a working project:

| Week | Topic | Goal |
|------|------|------|
| 1 | Prompts & Chains | Control LLM behavior using templates |
| 2 | Tool Calling | Make agents take actions |
| 3 | Memory | Long-term, dynamic agents |
| 4 | RAG | Knowledge-aware systems |
| … | … | Towards autonomous agents |

Each week adds another layer of intelligence.

## 🧱 Technologies I Will Use

| Stack | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| **LangChain** | Agent orchestration |
| **Groq / OpenAI Models** | LLM inference |
| **Python** | Core implementation |
| **Vector DBs** | Retrieval & memory |
| **Prompt Engineering** | Behavior design |

---

## 🏁 End Goal

By the end of this journey, I aim to have:

- 🛠️ 10–16 mini agent projects
- 🎯 1 capstone-level autonomous agent
- 📜 A public-facing AI engineering portfolio
- 🚀 Industry-ready skills in LangChain, RAG, and Agent Architectures

---

## 💡 My Philosophy

> *I believe the future belongs to those who can teach machines how to think,  
not just how to answer.*  
This repo is my step toward that future.

### ⭐ Stay Tuned

More files, agents, and demos will be added here **week by week**.  
Feel free to follow, fork, or collaborate.

Welcome to the journey.  
The next chapter of AI starts **here**.
